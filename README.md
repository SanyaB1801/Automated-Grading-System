Automated Grading System
Overview
This Automated Grading System leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide efficient and accurate grading of student responses. Developed using PyTorch, the system utilizes a BERT-based sentence transformer, attention masking, Kmeans clustering, and cosine similarity to analyze, group, and grade submissions.

Features
PyTorch Implementation: Utilizes PyTorch for efficient NLP operations.
BERT-based Sentence Transformer: Analyzes student responses using a transformer model based on BERT.
Attention Masking: Enhances accuracy by focusing on crucial elements in the responses.
Kmeans Clustering: Groups similar student submissions for consistent grading.
Cosine Similarity: Measures the similarity between responses for precise grading.
